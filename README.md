Vierbeiner





>> Project description:
Vierbeiner is a four-legged mobile robot, designed and developed from scratch, featuring three degrees of freedom for dynamic movement. It is controlled via a radio controller, offering precision and responsiveness.
What sets Vierbeiner apart from most IoT-based quadruped robots is its innovative two-leg algorithm, where two legs simultaneously adjust their positions relative to the world frame during movement. This approach surpasses the conventional one-leg algorithm by enhancing speed and efficiency per step, making Vierbeiner both agile and optimized for real-world applications.
At the heart of Vierbeiner lies the versatile ATmega2560 microcontroller, whose abundance of PWM pins eliminates the need for external drivers, streamlining the robot's design and functionality.
This project embodies the principles of practical engineering and modern robotics optimization. Special thanks to Arnav Bajaj for his invaluable assistance in soldering the supply lineâ€”an indispensable contribution that made this project a reality.
